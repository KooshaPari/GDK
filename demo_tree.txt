📈 Repository Statistics:
Average Health: 0.79
Healthy Commits (>0.8): 8/12

Legend:
🌀 = Spiral branch (infinite monkey iterations)
🔀 = Merge commit
🌳 = Continuing branch  
🌿 = Terminal branch
💚 = Green thread (excellent health)
🟢 = Light Green thread (good health)
🟡 = Yellow thread (moderate health)  
🟠 = Orange thread (poor health)
🔴 = Red thread (critical issues)

This visualization shows how the GDK system represents:
- Each commit as a node with health scores and thread colors
- Spiral branches for iterative convergence attempts
- Thread quality across different files in each commit
- The organic tree structure showing actual git relationships
- Health trends and convergence patterns over time
